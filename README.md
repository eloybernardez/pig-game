# Pig Game

A game where two players throw a 6-sided dice repeteadly, adding the dice number to the player score, until the current player gets a 1. If that happen, the current player score turns 0 and the other player starts to throw the dice. The current player doesn't win automatically when he/she reaches a score greater or equal than 100. A player only wins if he/she gets a score EXACTLY of 100 and holds.
